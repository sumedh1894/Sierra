MailEnable Connector for Microsoft Outlook

Release Notes
-------------
This client installation installs a MAPI Service Provider for Microsoft Outlook (2003 and later).
The service provider provides rich Outlook Collaboration with MailEnable Enterprise Premium servers.

Microsoft Outlook Configuration
-------------------------------
Once the client software has been installed, an Outlook profile will need to be either created or updated to allow you to access the MailEnable server.

The following instructions are available for creating a new Outlook Profile for connecting to the MailEnable Enterprise Premium server.

1. Either from within Outlook or from the Windows control panel, launch the wizard for creating a new profile.
2. In the Add New E-Mail Account window, check the box to "manually configure server settings or additional server types" and click Next.
3. A list of e-mail services should be listed containing "Internet E-mail", "Microsoft Exchange" and "Other". You should select the "Other" option, and from the list, select the "MailEnable Server" list item.
4. You can now configure the settings for connecting and accessing the MailEnable Server. These follow below:

	4.1 In the server address, specify the host name or IP address of the server running MailEnable.
	4.2 For the account name, you should supply your MailEnable login in the form of Mailbox@Postoffice.
	4.3 Enter the corresponding password for the above login
	4.4 Enter your friendly name - typically first name followed by surname
	4.5 Email address: Enter the primary email address for the login you have specified
	4.6 For the account description, you can enter a name that will allow you to idenitfy the mailbox in Outlook - eg: your mailbox name
	4.7 An advanced check box is available to allow you to configure some additional settings. In particular, the "Mailbox:" field on the Mailbox tab allows you to optionally specify another users mailbox to open (so you may access the resources of their mailbox while logged in with your own credentials). Under normal configuration, you could leave this field blank or the mailbox name associated with your own login. The other settings are largely self explanatory.

Having configured the above, you can click OK and Outlook will configure the profile for access and allow you to login.
